    "detail" : "15 minutes and only 8 ingredients for some extra delicious garlicky spicy noodles!\nThese noodles are saucy, spicy, a little bit sweet, and full of umami. They’re extra garlicky and vegan! Of course, you can add extra protein and veggies to this to bulk it up and make it a whole meal. These noodles are super versatile and the best part is that they come together amazingly quickly.\nWe love noodles. So much that we wrote a whole book dedicated to noodles. We never tire of eating and making noodles at home and we’re always noodling around with new recipes. This is one of our classic go-tos: a super simple umami packed sauce with wide chewy rice noodles. They’re ready in under 15 minutes and are full of flavor."

Yes, yes yaaaaahm! We’ve tried it and loved it and you will too!\nYou can also totally play around with your vegetable choices in there. We really loved the sweet green springy combo of the peas and asparagus, but you could for sure empty your fresh produce haul into this for a real pasta primavera sensation."

If you don’t already have a container of them made and waiting (or if you did but you already ate them like cereal….been known to happen), then you can find out how here or see the recipe notes for a quick cheat version. Yays all around!"
